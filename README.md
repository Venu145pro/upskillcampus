To set up a Flask application for your URL shortener project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python
Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: python.org. During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".

2. Create a Project Directory
First, create a new folder for your project.
-->> mkdir url-shortener
-->> cd url-shortener

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for each project to manage dependencies separately.

--->> To create a virtual environment, use the following command:

On Windows:
--->>python -m venv venv


--->> Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
--->>venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install Flask
Once the virtual environment is activated, install Flask using pip:
--->>pip install Flask

6. Set Up Your Flask Application
Create a file named app.py in your project directory

7. Run the Flask Application
To run the Flask application, execute the following command in your terminal:

--->>flask run
